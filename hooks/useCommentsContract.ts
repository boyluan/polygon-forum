// Import our contract ABI (a json representation of our contract's public interface)
// The hardhat compiler writes this file to artifacts during compilation
// ## Steps for Vercel deployment â¬‡â¬‡
// 1) Create a new folder at the root directory called 'utils'
// 2) Add a .json file to this /utils folder - to hold your smart contract's corresponding abi file
// 3) Copy + Paste contents from the abi file, into the new .json file you've created in the /utils directory
// 4) Import the new .json file under its new /utils directory (contd. below)
// Into each JavaScript/Typescript file that needs to reference my smart contract (see: Line 26)
// See: <https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/34502>
