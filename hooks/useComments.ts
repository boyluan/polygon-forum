// This hook is responsible for managing react state around the promise lifecycle of our 'getComments' function
// To do this, we'll use react-query (see: <https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview>)

// 'react-query' fetches data on our behalf, and provides use useful state helpers such as:
// isLoading, isSuccess, and isError
